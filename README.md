## What Is This?

Android Horizon is a **compatibility / translation layer** that lets Android native (NDK) games run directly on the Nintendo Switch's **Horizon OS** — the Switch's real operating system.

**This is NOT Android running on the Switch.** There is no Android OS, no emulator, no virtual machine. The game's ARM64 machine code runs directly on the Switch's Tegra X1 processor, the same chip Android phones use. A thin shim layer fakes just enough of the Android runtime (libc, OpenGL ES, JNI, asset management) that the game's native `.so` library doesn't notice it isn't on Android.

Think of it like Wine on Linux — not emulation, but translation.

### Current Focus

We are currently only attempting **simple, old, 2D Android games** — specifically games that:

- Ship an `arm64-v8a` native library (`.so` file)
- Use OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0 for rendering
- Have **no** Google Play Services dependency
- Save locally (no cloud saves required)
- **Do not require network/online connectivity**

Our test target is **Hill Climb Racing 1.x** by Fingersoft — a simple 2D physics game with no online requirement, widely used in compatibility testing.

### What We've Achieved So Far

**Hill Climb Racing is playable on real Switch hardware.** Not "boots" — playable: touch-steering the car up the hill, engine and music audio, a locked 60 fps, in-game HUD, coins and gems. This is real Android NDK game code, unmodified, running directly on the Tegra X1 through switch-mesa — no Android OS anywhere in the loop.

The full pipeline that works today:

- The NRO launches from hbmenu (or an application-mode forwarder) with a themed APK browser UI
- APK extraction — native libraries and assets unpacked from the `.apk` onto the SD card
- All three ELF binaries (`libapplovin-native-crash-reporter.so`, `libquack.so`, `libgame.so`) load, relocate, and link against the shim table with **zero unresolved symbols**
- All **417 native C++ constructors** run clean, `JNI_OnLoad` completes, and real libnx threads run the game's background asset loader alongside the main render/game thread
- **Touch input** drives the car (steering/gas/brake) via the game's own registered touch natives — this is genuinely playable, not just rendering
- **Audio works** — engine sound, music, and effects via a custom SDL2_mixer backend reading OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC straight from the APK's assets
- **A locked 60 fps** in normal play
- The fake JNI layer answers hundreds of thousands of calls (UserDefaults, market queries, AES encrypt/decrypt passthrough, audio engine hooks, real Switch connectivity status)
- Live on-screen log feed during loading, full diagnostics in `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/compat_log.txt`, and **automatic screenshots** of key moments saved to `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`
- Crash forensics: symbolized abort/exit backtraces with full frame-pointer backtraces, unrecovered-fault PC/region capture, and the game's own debug output routed into the log

**Known issues from hardware playtesting (see [Current Blockers](#current-blockers)):** the **Shop** screen crashes back out to the launcher, and save persistence needs another confirmed round-trip test (the mechanism is implemented and the log shows it loading/saving, but a full-restart verification is still outstanding).

The road here, each step root-caused on real hardware: JIT data pages needed RW after the executable transition (417 ctor faults) → `std::random_device` aborted because `/dev/urandom` doesn't exist (now served by the Switch CSRNG) → the asset-loader thread froze the game because `pthread_create` ran it inline (now real libnx threads) → a vorbis ABI mismatch corrupted the heap on the first sound effect (now uses the Tremor decoder SDL2_mixer actually expects) → an async Java callback (`fetchCountryCode`) left the post-EULA screen spinning forever (now answered immediately) → the engine sound played at full volume forever because its per-channel volume control was silently dropped (now wired through).

## Screenshots

**Every screenshot below was captured automatically by Android Horizon itself, on real Switch hardware** — the launcher saves a PNG of each UI screen to `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`, and the game loop snapshots the actual GL framebuffer at milestone frames to prove what really rendered. None of these are mockups or emulator captures.

## Controls

> **Handheld mode only.** Android games use touch screen input. The Switch touchscreen only works in handheld mode — in docked mode there is no touch input, so games will be uncontrollable. Android Horizon detects docked mode and shows a warning in the footer.

**Android Horizon launcher controls (in the APK browser):**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad / Left stick | Navigate APK list |
| **A** | Launch selected APK |
| **X** | Reinstall + Launch (re-extracts APK) |
| **Y** | Rescan APK folder |
| **−** | About screen |
| **+** | Quit |
| **B** | Back (on result screen) |

---

## Setup

1. Copy `AndroidHorizonNX.nro` to `sdmc:/switch/`
2. Place `.apk` files in `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/apks/`
3. Launch from hbmenu (Atmosphere CFW required)
4. Navigate with D-pad or left stick, press **A** to launch
5. If a launch fails, check `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/compat_log.txt` for the full error log

---

## Building

Requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with `devkitA64` and `libnx` installed.

## Current Blockers

These are the known issues preventing Hill Climb Racing from running:

### 1. ~~Code pages not executable~~ — **RESOLVED**

The ELF loader now uses the SplitMap technique: two `svcCreateCodeMemory` handles placed at adjacent virtual addresses. The code segment is mapped `MapSlave` (Rx) and the data segment `MapOwner` (Rw). ARM64 ADRP instructions can address ±4GB, so adjacent placement lets executed code reach GOT/data without any permission transitions. The old `0xD801` error no longer occurs.

### 2. ~~JMPREL unresolved~~ — **RESOLVED (all 403 entries)**

All 403 JMPREL entries in the crash reporter library resolve successfully. The test log confirms `JMPREL: all 403 entries processed` and `ELF: jmprel done`.

### 3. ~~SplitMap memcpy crash~~ — **RESOLVED**

After JMPREL, the ELF loader was crashing on `memcpy(code_heap_buf, ...)` because `svcCreateCodeMemory` was called too early, making the backing buffer inaccessible before we wrote to it. Fixed: `svcCreateCodeMemory` + `svcControlCodeMemory` are now deferred until after the memcpy.

### 4. ~~Native constructors~~ — **RESOLVED (all 417 run clean)**

Root cause: `jitTransitionToExecutable` made the entire JIT region RX, including the data segment, so the very first constructor writing a C++ global hit a permission fault. Fix: data-segment pages are flipped back to RW after the executable transition, matching the Android linker's layout. `ctors done ok=417 failed=0`.

### 5. ~~Game calls `abort()` after ~165s~~ — **RESOLVED**

Root cause: `std::random_device`'s constructor opens `/dev/urandom`, which doesn't exist on Horizon OS; the `-fno-exceptions` build turns that failure into an instant `abort()`. Fixed by serving `/dev/urandom` as a virtual file backed by the Switch's hardware RNG.

### 6. ~~No audio~~ — **RESOLVED**

A custom SDL2_mixer backend now serves every SimpleAudioEngine JNI call — background music and sound effects (OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC) decode straight from the extracted APK assets. Per-channel effect volume (used for the engine sound) is wired through; per-channel *pitch/rate* is not — SDL_mixer has no API for changing an individual channel's playback speed without a full custom resampling engine, so the engine note doesn't rise and fall with RPM yet (volume does).

### 7. ~~Background threads run synchronously~~ — **RESOLVED**

`pthread_create` now spawns real libnx threads (pinned off the render core), with real mutexes/condvars/semaphores/rwlocks backing the game's synchronization primitives.

### 8. ~~Touch input not delivered~~ — **RESOLVED**

Confirmed on hardware: SDL finger events drive the game's own touch natives, and the car is fully steerable.

### 9. Shop screen crashes back to the launcher — **ACTIVE INVESTIGATION**

Opening the in-game Shop crashes out to the Android Horizon menu. No fault or abort was captured in the log from the crash session (the log simply stops mid-stream with no exit marker), which pointed at a possible deadlock in the crash-forensics logger itself: if the crashing thread happened to fault while already holding the log's mutex (e.g. mid-format inside an ordinary log call), the old fault handler would try to take that same mutex to report the crash and hang forever — a real bug, now fixed with a lock-free emergency logger for exactly this scenario. The Shop is also the most network/IAP-heavy screen, and until this build `isNetworkAvailable` always claimed "online" regardless of the Switch's actual connection — an offline Switch reporting itself online could easily send the game into a real network call that has no chance of succeeding. Both fixes are in; needs a fresh test + log to confirm.

### 10. Save persistence — needs a confirmed round-trip test

The UserDefault store now loads from and saves to `<game>/userdefaults.bin` (ints, floats, bools, strings), and the compat log shows it loading and saving correctly during play. However this hasn't yet been confirmed by a full app-restart-and-relaunch test on hardware, so treat it as "implemented, not yet verified" rather than "working."

### 11. One game session per app launch

Launching a second game session in the same Android Horizon process reads garbage ("not an ARM binary") — leftover JIT memory regions and threads from the first session aren't unloaded. Currently guarded with an on-screen notice instead of a crash; a real unload path is future work.

## Performance Expectations (Hill Climb Racing 1.67.0)

We're testing the `.apk` release of **Hill Climb Racing 1.67.0** specifically — the current Play Store release ships as a `.xapk`. Android Horizon's APK parser only understands plain `.apk` files right now, so `.xapk` support is out of scope until a later phase.

Measured numbers from hardware:

- **A locked 60 fps during actual gameplay** — the theoretical ceiling is also the measured result. (Earlier builds measured ~18 fps in the menu before a logging bottleneck was found and fixed — see the 0.1.65 changelog entry — real gameplay performance is native-class.)
- Loading time has come down substantially since the early ~143 s measurement, once JNI log spam (thousands of save-key reads, each fsyncing to the SD card) was throttled — see 0.1.65.
- Hill Climb Racing was tuned for 2012-era phones far weaker than the Tegra X1, so there's little pressure on performance work right now; focus is on correctness (Shop crash, save verification) over speed.

## TODO / Roadmap

> Items are roughly ordered by priority. "Phase 0" is the current work.

### Phase 0 — Make any game do *something* (in progress)

- [x] APK browser UI with icon extraction
- [x] APK extraction (libs + assets) onto SD card
- [x] Custom ARM64 ELF loader with RELA relocation
- [x] JNI environment shim (fake JavaVM / JNIEnv)
- [x] EGL setup (GLES 2 + 3 shim table passthrough)
- [x] On-screen progress display during launch stages
- [x] Full diagnostic result screen with error details
- [x] Docked mode detection — footer warns when not in handheld mode
- [x] Early abort when code pages are not executable — shows diagnostic screen instead of crashing Switch
- [x] **SplitMap JIT** — adjacent RW+Rx dual-mapping via two `svcCreateCodeMemory` handles; 0xD801 blocker resolved
- [x] All 120+ unresolved symbols shimmed
- [x] **Per-constructor logging** — crash site shows in `compat_log.txt`
- [x] **Load all .so files** — all three libs loaded smallest-first; cross-library symbols available before constructors run
- [x] **40+ additional shims** — signal handling, thread naming, memory, barriers, etc.
- [x] **Live progress screen** — loader runs on a background thread; main thread renders at ~60fps with animated scan bar and live `compat_log.txt` tail (13 lines, colour-coded)
- [x] **Elapsed time per stage** — stage label shows "(Xs)" so you can tell how long each step is taking
- [x] **All 403 JMPREL entries resolved** — confirmed in hardware test
- [x] **All 417 constructors run clean** — JIT data pages flipped back to RW after executable transition
- [x] **Game boots and renders** — splash animation, full loading screen, menu logic, ~18 fps
- [x] **Crash forensics** — symbolized abort/exit backtraces, unrecovered-fault PC capture, game stderr + debug strings routed to compat log
- [x] **Automatic screenshots** — launcher screens + GL framebuffer at milestone frames saved to `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`
- [x] **Fixed the ~165s `abort()`** — root cause `/dev/urandom` missing on Horizon OS, served by the Switch CSRNG
- [x] **Touch input delivered** — SDL finger events → Cocos2dxRenderer touch natives (1:1 coords); B button → Android BACK key; **confirmed steering the car on hardware**
- [x] **Audio playback** — SDL2_mixer backend for SimpleAudioEngine (music + effects, OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC); **confirmed working on hardware** (engine, music)
- [x] **GAME IS PLAYABLE** — driving, touch, audio, 60fps, confirmed on Switch hardware
- [ ] Shop screen crash (active investigation — see Current Blockers #9)
- [ ] Confirm save persistence survives a full app restart

### Phase 1 — Touch input

- [x] Map Switch touchscreen events to the game's touch natives (direct `Java_...nativeTouches*` calls rather than the `AInputQueue`/`ALooper` path — simpler and confirmed working)
- [x] Docked-mode detection — footer shows warning when not in handheld mode

### Phase 2 — Stability

- [x] **Real `pthread` support using libnx `Thread`** — real threads, real mutex/condvar/rwlock/semaphore backing
- [x] Load all `.so` files in dependency order (smallest-first)
- [ ] Implement `dl_iterate_phdr` so stack unwinders work
- [x] **Save/load state** — UserDefaults persist to `<game>/userdefaults.bin` (needs a confirmed restart test, see blockers)
- [ ] Real `.so`/JIT unload so a second game session doesn't require restarting the app
- [ ] Engine/effect pitch control (needs a custom audio resampler — SDL_mixer has no per-channel rate API)

### Phase 3 — Polish

- [x] NRO icon (Android Horizon themed — green planet with curved text)
- [x] **Icon-themed UI** — animated starfield, planet-horizon scenery, borealis-style glowing focus card, HOS button glyphs from the system font
- [x] Dynamic GitHub avatar on About screen
- [x] About screen (press **−**)
- [x] Reinstall button (**X** in APK list)
- [x] Version bump system — NACP + in-app version both track the build number (`0.1.<build>`)
- [ ] Per-APK settings overlay (resolution, framerate cap)
- [ ] APK delete / manage from the UI

### Not Planned (for now)

- Online / multiplayer games (Roblox, Fortnite, etc.)
- Google Play Services (GMS) stub
- ARM32 (`armeabi-v7a`) game support — Switch is 64-bit only

---

## Changelog

> Most recent first.

### 0.1.69 — Engine volume fix + crash-logger deadlock hardening

- [x] **Fixed the engine sound never stopping/fading** — the game continuously calls `setEffectVolume(id, volume)` to ramp the looping engine sound with RPM and to silence it on crash/pause/menu; this call was falling through to the generic no-op logger and being silently dropped, so the engine played at its initial volume forever. Now wired to a real per-channel `Mix_Volume`. (`setEffectRate`, the pitch counterpart, is a deliberate no-op — SDL_mixer has no per-channel playback-rate API without a custom resampler.)
- [x] **Real Switch connectivity reported to the game** — `isNetworkAvailable` now queries `nifm` instead of always claiming online. Matters for the Shop investigation: an offline Switch previously told the game it *was* online, which could push it into a real (doomed) network call.
- [x] **Crash-logger deadlock fixed** — the Shop-crash log had no fault/abort line at all, just silence. Root cause: if a thread faults while it already holds the normal logger's mutex (e.g. mid-format inside an ordinary log call), the old fault handler tried to take that same mutex to report the crash — permanent deadlock, no diagnostics, looks like a frozen game until force-quit. Added a lock-free emergency logger used only by the crash-forensics paths, so a fault can now always be recorded no matter what the crashing thread was doing.
- [x] Added the driving-gameplay and launch-result screenshots to this README — first real in-game screenshots from hardware.

### 0.1.68 — IT'S PLAYABLE + persistent saves

- [x] **HILL CLIMB RACING IS PLAYABLE ON SWITCH** — driving with touch steering, engine sounds, music, 60 fps. Confirmed on hardware. Known issues from the playtest below.
- [x] **Saves now persist** — the UserDefault store was RAM-only, so every launch looked like a first run (ToS screen again, progress lost). It now loads from `<game>/userdefaults.bin` before the game starts and saves on every `UserDefault.flush` and at exit. Ints, floats, bools, and strings all covered (floats/bools weren't even stored before).
- [x] **Real connectivity reported** — `isNetworkAvailable` now asks the Switch (nifm) instead of always claiming "online". An offline Switch gets Android's normal offline code paths — the game handles that natively, and it likely defuses the shop's network/IAP flows (the playtest's only crash).
- [x] **Effect volume fixed** — `playEffect`'s gain parameter was discarded, so looping effects (the engine!) played at 100%. Gain is now applied per channel. (Pitch modulation isn't supported by SDL_mixer, so the engine is volume-correct but monotone for now.)
- [x] **Relaunch guard** — launching a second game session in one app run crashes the loader (leftover JIT regions/threads from the first session; "not an ARM binary"). Until real unloading exists, a second launch shows a "restart Android Horizon to play again" notice instead of crashing.
- [x] Async Java callback pattern established (`compatFindGameSym`) — used for `returnCountryCode`, ready for `setServerTime`/`returnMissionJson`/`returnFileDownloadResult` if the game stalls on them.

### 0.1.66 — Touch confirmed + post-EULA spinner fixed

- [x] **TOUCH CONFIRMED WORKING** — the Terms-of-Service screen was accepted by tapping on hardware. Also: the logging diet pushed the game loop to a solid **60 fps** (frame counter: 300 frames per 5 s) — the SD-card fsyncs were throttling rendering too.
- [x] **Post-EULA spinner root-caused** — after accepting, the game calls `fetchCountryCode()`; on Android that's an async Java web request answered via the native callback `returnCountryCode(jstring)`. No reply = infinite spinner. The JNI layer now invokes the game's registered callback immediately with `"US"` (which also keeps the game on the simpler non-GDPR consent path).
- [x] **Music no longer keeps playing after quitting the game** — the mixer is silenced when the game loop exits back to the APK browser.

### 0.1.65 — Audio works! + loading-screen speedup

- [x] **AUDIO CONFIRMED WORKING ON HARDWARE** — build 64's Tremor fix holds: menu music (`bgmusic00.ogg`) loops from the Switch speakers while the game renders. First sound ever from an Android game on Horizon OS via this layer.
- [x] **"Stuck" loading screen root-caused: it wasn't stuck** — the game reads thousands of per-vehicle/per-stage save keys, and every read produced 3 compat-log lines each fsync'd to the SD card (~90 keys/second measured). The run was minutes from finishing when it looked frozen.
- [x] **JNI logging diet** — class/method/field lookups and repeated calls log once per unique message; save-key reads are silent with a periodic progress counter; writes log once per key. Loading should now be dramatically faster.

### 0.1.64 — The real frame-2 killer: vorbis ABI mismatch

- [x] **Frame-2 crash fully root-caused** — build 63 still crashed, and the forensics narrowed it to `_free_r` freeing SDL_mixer's own `sdl_seek_func` (an OGG callback *function*). Disassembling portlibs' `libSDL2_mixer.a` showed its OGG decoder calls `ov_read` with 4 arguments — the **Tremor** (`libvorbisidec`) ABI — while we linked regular `libvorbisfile`, whose `ov_read` takes 7 arguments and whose `OggVorbis_File` struct is a different size. `ov_open_callbacks` scribbled past the mixer's smaller struct on the first `preloadEffect(*.ogg)`, corrupting the heap.
- [x] **Fix:** link `-lvorbisidec` (Tremor) instead of `-lvorbisfile -lvorbis`, matching what SDL2_mixer was compiled against.

### 0.1.63 — Allocator crash root-caused: JNI string constants

- [x] **Build 59/60 frame-2 crash root-caused via the new forensics** — `svcQueryMemory` + host-symbol anchoring resolved the fault to newlib's `_free_r` writing a free-list link into our NRO's read-only segment: the game `free()`d a JNI string we handed it. On real Android, `GetStringUTFChars` returns a malloc'd copy (so game code that `free()`s it instead of calling `ReleaseStringUTFChars` gets away with it); ours returned the string constant itself.
- [x] **Fix 1:** `GetStringUTFChars` now returns a real heap copy (ART-compatible) and `ReleaseStringUTFChars` frees it.
- [x] **Fix 2:** guarded allocator — `free`/`realloc` verify the pointer is actually heap (`svcQueryMemory`) before touching it, and log the symbolized caller of any non-heap free instead of corrupting the allocator.
- [x] Mixer init now happens before the game loop starts (was lazily mid-frame).
- [x] New crash forensics stay in: fault pc/far region type+permissions, host addresses anchored to a known symbol for offline resolution against the build's `.elf`.

### 0.1.59 — Touch + audio

- [x] **Real threads worked** — build 56 reached the game's Terms-of-Service / privacy screen: fully loaded, rendering, interactive (2,280 frames over 339 s in the test run, clean exit via +). The remaining gaps were input and sound.
- [x] **Touch input** — SDL finger events are forwarded to the game's registered `Cocos2dxRenderer` natives: `nativeTouchesBegin`/`End` per finger, `nativeTouchesMove` with real JNI arrays (the fake JNI array layer now implements `GetArrayLength` and all typed `Get/SetArrayRegion` calls instead of returning zeros). Touchscreen coordinates map 1:1 to the game's 1280×720 surface.
- [x] **B button → Android BACK key** via `nativeKeyDown(AKEYCODE_BACK)` — backs out of game menus like on a phone.
- [x] **Audio** — new SDL2_mixer backend (`source/compat/audio.cpp`) behind all SimpleAudioEngine JNI calls: background music (play/stop/pause/resume/rewind/volume) and sound effects (preload/play/stop/volume, cached chunks), OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC decoding, reading straight from the extracted APK assets.

### 0.1.56 — Real threads

- [x] **The urandom fix worked** — build 55 sailed past the old ~170s abort: `std::random_device` now reads the Switch CSRNG, and the game went on to initialize vehicles, achievements, and event assets. New blocker: it spawned a persistent asset-loader thread, and the old "run thread functions synchronously" shim froze the game on the HCR loading screen.
- [x] **`pthread_create` now creates real threads** (libnx `threadCreate`, 1 MB stack, pinned to cores 1/2 so workers can't starve the render loop on core 0), each with its own fake Bionic TLS block. `pthread_self`/`pthread_equal`/`pthread_join` are consistent between creator and thread.
- [x] **Real synchronization** — mutexes/condvars/rwlocks/semaphores are now backed by newlib/libnx primitives embedded inside the game's larger Bionic structs (recursive semantics; Bionic's static recursive-initializer bit pattern sanitized). `pthread_cond_timedwait` converts Bionic absolute timeouts and returns Bionic's `ETIMEDOUT`.
- [x] **Thread-safety hardening** — the compat logger and the JNI UserDefault store are mutex-guarded; crash recovery only `longjmp`s on the thread that armed it (worker faults get the symbolized unrecovered-fault log instead).

### 0.1.55 — Abort root-caused: `/dev/urandom`

- [x] **The ~170s abort is fully root-caused** — build 54's symbolized backtrace shows `std::random_device` ctor → `__throw_system_error` → `abort()`. The ctor opens `/dev/urandom` through bionic's *fortified* `__open_2` (which our logging never saw), the path doesn't exist on Horizon OS, and the `-fno-exceptions` build turns the throw into an abort.
- [x] **Fix: `/dev/urandom` virtual fd** — `open`/`__open_2` on `/dev/urandom` (or `/dev/random`) now return a magic fd backed by the Switch's hardware CSRNG; `read`/`__read_chk`/`close` handle it transparently.
- [x] Screenshots confirmed working on hardware — launcher UI, live loading screen, Fingersoft splash (frame 30), and the HCR loading bar (frame 300) all captured automatically.

### 0.1.53+ — The game renders!

- [x] **Hill Climb Racing boots on hardware** — Fingersoft splash animates, loading screen completes, menu logic runs at ~18 fps. Root cause of the constructor crashes: the JIT transition made data pages RX; they're now flipped back to RW, and all 417 ctors pass.
- [x] **Crash identified & instrumented** — the game calls `abort()` at ~165s from libc++'s `__throw_system_error` path (confirmed by symbolized caller: `libgame.so` `error_category::equivalent+0xec`). Added: frame-pointer backtrace with per-frame symbolization on abort/exit, unrecovered-fault PC/LR capture in the exception handler, recovery window widened over the whole game loop (incl. `eglSwapBuffers`).
- [x] **Game output captured** — `debugStringOnAndroid` JNI payloads, writes to the game's stdout/stderr (including through the fake Bionic `__sF`), and `android_set_abort_message` all land in `compat_log.txt` now.
- [x] **`getrandom` implemented** — `syscall(__NR_getrandom)`, `getentropy`, and `getrandom` are backed by the Switch CSRNG (`std::random_device` suspect for the abort).
- [x] **Automatic screenshots** — launcher saves `ui_menu/ui_loading/ui_result/ui_about.png`; the game loop saves the GL framebuffer at frames 30/300/900. All in `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`.
- [x] **Epic UI overhaul** — icon-matched theme: gradient space sky, 110 twinkling/drifting stars, green planet horizon with glowing rim (cached to a texture), borealis-style eased focus card with pulsing glow, real HOS button glyphs (, , …) from the NintendoExt system font with chip fallback, translucent header/footer, 60 fps menu.
- [x] **Version system** — NACP version (shown in hbmenu) and the in-app version both derive from the auto-incrementing build number; the stale `.nacp` is regenerated every build.

### Loader bring-up

- [x] **SplitMap crash fixed** — root cause: `svcCreateCodeMemory` was called before `memcpy`, making the backing buffer inaccessible at userspace. Fixed by deferring `svcCreateCodeMemory` + `svcControlCodeMemory` to after the memcpy. All three `.so` files should now load past the ELF copy stage.
- [x] **RELA/JMPREL logging dramatically reduced** — removed per-entry log lines (one `fflush` per entry on FAT32 was taking ~38 seconds for libapplovin alone). Now only unresolved symbols, WARN lines, and the end-of-table summary are logged — `applyRela` goes from ~8000 lines to ~30 per library.
- [x] **+ button exits progress screen** — press **+** at any time during ELF loading to stop waiting and return to the APK list
- [x] **Renamed to Android Horizon / AndroidHorizonNX** — reflects the project's purpose (Android on HorizonOS) more clearly
- [x] **Live animated progress screen** — loader now runs on a background libnx thread; main thread renders at ~60fps with: animated scan bar (always moving, independent of load progress), live tail of `compat_log.txt` (13 lines, colour-coded for errors/warnings), elapsed time display per stage, "still working" notice after 30s
- [x] **Log timestamps** — every `compat_log.txt` entry prefixed with `[Xs]` seconds-since-launch
- [x] **Immediate constructor logging** — each `ELF: ctor[k/417] @ptr` is force-flushed to disk and the live display the instant before the constructor runs, so a hanging constructor is immediately identifiable
- [x] **"Please wait" patience notice** — log and screen show total constructor count and estimated time before the phase begins
- [x] **Avatar fix** — `socketInitializeDefault()` added so curl/BSD sockets work in homebrew; GitHub URL corrected to Aaronateataco
- [x] **Expanded log ring buffer** (5×92 → 20×128 bytes) for richer in-memory log feed
- [x] **All 403 JMPREL entries resolve** — hardware-confirmed; constructors are now the active frontier
- [x] **Android Horizon icon** — green planet with "ANDROID HORIZON" curved above the horizon, space background with stars
- [x] **About screen** (press **−**) with live GitHub avatar + project info
- [x] **Reinstall button** (**X**) — re-extracts APK without needing to delete the game folder

### [Previous builds]

- [x] **Performance Expectations section** added to README
- [x] **APK chooser QoL**: WebP icon decoding, linear icon scaling, colored monogram placeholders, larger icons, file size shown per APK
- [x] **Heap staging buffer for ELF loading** — fixed hard crash on first write to JIT-writable memory
- [x] **Per-relocation-entry logging + bounds checks** in `applyRela()` — bounds-checks `sym.st_name` against `DT_STRSZ`, caps `R_AARCH64_COPY` size at 64KB
- [x] **Per-constructor logging** — `elfRunCtors()` logs each constructor address + index and flushes before calling it
- [x] **Load all .so files** — replaced `findMainSo` with `findAllSos`; all three libs are loaded smallest-first
- [x] **40+ new shims** — `sigaction`, signal sets, `prctl`, `gettid`, `getpid`, `getuid`, `getgid`, `getauxval`, `mprotect`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `pipe`, `dup`, `dup2`, `ioctl`, `access`, `chmod`, `fchmod`, `lstat`, `pthread_setname_np`, `pthread_getname_np`, `pthread_attr_setstack`, `pthread_barrier_*`, `kill`, `raise`, `pthread_kill`, `sleep`, `usleep`, `clock_nanosleep`, `strtod_l`, `strtof_l`, `__register_atfork`
- [x] **ELF loader: SplitMap JIT** — `MapSlave` (Rx) + `MapOwner` (Rw) at adjacent VAs; 0xD801 blocker resolved
- [x] **120+ shims**: `setjmp`/`longjmp`, `sem_*`, all time functions, all wide-char and locale functions, all Bionic fortified string wrappers, networking stubs, `android_set_abort_message`, `sincosf`, `stpcpy`, `vasprintf`, `vsscanf`, `strerror`, `strtold`, `puts`/`putchar`, `rename`/`remove`, `__sF`, `__stack_chk_guard`, `pthread_mutexattr_*`, `__cxa_finalize`
- [x] Capture svc result codes from ELF loader and surface on diagnostic screen
- [x] Abort launch early when code pages not executable — diagnostic screen instead of Switch crash
- [x] Add `LaunchResult` struct — structured error info instead of bare bool
- [x] Add `ProgressCb` callback — UI shows each launch stage on-screen in real time
- [x] Docked mode detection — footer turns amber and warns

### 0.1.0 — Initial release

- [x] APK browser UI (SDL2, 1280×720)
- [x] APK icon + metadata extraction (AndroidManifest.xml + resources.arsc parser)
- [x] Full APK extraction to SD card (libs + assets)
- [x] Custom ARM64 ELF loader with RELA relocation processing
- [x] JNI / JavaVM fake environment
- [x] GLES 2 + GLES 3 shim table (400+ functions)
- [x] EGL setup via switch-mesa
- [x] SD card logging (`log.txt` + `compat_log.txt`)

## About

Made by [Aaron](https://aaronworld.uk) — a non-developer who wanted to see Android games on their modded Switch, and is figuring it out one step at a time with the help of Claude AI.

> **~99.8% of all code in this repo was written by [Claude](https://anthropic.com) (claude-sonnet-4-6 model).** I describe the problem, test on real hardware, and point out what's broken. Claude writes the fixes. This is an honest experiment in AI-assisted hardware hacking.

If this interests you, star the repo and check back. Progress will be slow but real.
