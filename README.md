## What Is This?

Android Horizon is a **compatibility / translation layer** that lets Android native (NDK) games run directly on the Nintendo Switch's **Horizon OS** — the Switch's real operating system.

**This is NOT Android running on the Switch.** There is no Android OS, no emulator, no virtual machine. The game's ARM64 machine code runs directly on the Switch's Tegra X1 processor, the same chip Android phones use. A thin shim layer fakes just enough of the Android runtime (libc, OpenGL ES, JNI, asset management) that the game's native `.so` library doesn't notice it isn't on Android.

Think of it like Wine on Linux — not emulation, but translation.

### Current Focus

We are currently only attempting **simple, old, 2D Android games** — specifically games that:

- Ship an `arm64-v8a` native library (`.so` file)
- Use OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0 for rendering
- Have **no** Google Play Services dependency
- Save locally (no cloud saves required)
- **Do not require network/online connectivity**

Our test target is **Hill Climb Racing 1.x** by Fingersoft — a simple 2D physics game with no online requirement, widely used in compatibility testing.

### What We've Achieved So Far

**Hill Climb Racing is playable on real Switch hardware.** Not "boots" — playable: touch-steering the car up the hill, engine and music audio, a locked 60 fps, in-game HUD, coins and gems. This is real Android NDK game code, unmodified, running directly on the Tegra X1 through switch-mesa — no Android OS anywhere in the loop.

The full pipeline that works today:

- The NRO launches from hbmenu (or an application-mode forwarder) with a themed APK browser UI
- APK extraction — native libraries and assets unpacked from the `.apk` onto the SD card
- All three ELF binaries (`libapplovin-native-crash-reporter.so`, `libquack.so`, `libgame.so`) load, relocate, and link against the shim table with **zero unresolved symbols**
- All **417 native C++ constructors** run clean, `JNI_OnLoad` completes, and real libnx threads run the game's background asset loader alongside the main render/game thread
- **Touch input** drives the car (steering/gas/brake) via the game's own registered touch natives — this is genuinely playable, not just rendering
- **Audio works** — engine sound, music, and effects via a custom SDL2_mixer backend reading OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC straight from the APK's assets
- **A locked 60 fps** in normal play
- The fake JNI layer answers hundreds of thousands of calls (UserDefaults, market queries, AES encrypt/decrypt passthrough, audio engine hooks, real Switch connectivity status)
- Live on-screen log feed during loading, full diagnostics in `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/compat_log.txt`, and **automatic screenshots** of key moments saved to `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`
- Crash forensics: symbolized abort/exit backtraces with full frame-pointer backtraces, unrecovered-fault PC/region capture, and the game's own debug output routed into the log

**Known issues from hardware playtesting (see [Current Blockers](#current-blockers)):** the **Shop** screen crashes back out to the launcher, and save persistence needs another confirmed round-trip test (the mechanism is implemented and the log shows it loading/saving, but a full-restart verification is still outstanding).

The road here, each step root-caused on real hardware: JIT data pages needed RW after the executable transition (417 ctor faults) → `std::random_device` aborted because `/dev/urandom` doesn't exist (now served by the Switch CSRNG) → the asset-loader thread froze the game because `pthread_create` ran it inline (now real libnx threads) → a vorbis ABI mismatch corrupted the heap on the first sound effect (now uses the Tremor decoder SDL2_mixer actually expects) → an async Java callback (`fetchCountryCode`) left the post-EULA screen spinning forever (now answered immediately) → the engine sound played at full volume forever because its per-channel volume control was silently dropped (now wired through).

## Screenshots

**Every screenshot below was captured automatically by Android Horizon itself, on real Switch hardware** — the launcher saves a PNG of each UI screen to `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`, and the game loop snapshots the actual GL framebuffer at milestone frames to prove what really rendered. None of these are mockups or emulator captures.

## Controls

> **Handheld mode only.** Android games use touch screen input. The Switch touchscreen only works in handheld mode — in docked mode there is no touch input, so games will be uncontrollable. Android Horizon detects docked mode and shows a warning in the footer.

**Android Horizon launcher controls (in the APK browser):**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad / Left stick | Navigate APK list |
| **A** | Launch selected APK |
| **X** | Reinstall + Launch (re-extracts APK) |
| **Y** | Rescan APK folder |
| **−** | About screen |
| **+** | Quit |
| **B** | Back (on result screen) |

---

## Setup

1. Copy `AndroidHorizonNX.nro` to `sdmc:/switch/`
2. Place `.apk` files in `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/apks/`
3. Launch from hbmenu (Atmosphere CFW required)
4. Navigate with D-pad or left stick, press **A** to launch
5. If a launch fails, check `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/compat_log.txt` for the full error log

---

## Building

Requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with `devkitA64` and `libnx` installed.

```sh
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro

## Current Blockers

These are the known issues preventing Hill Climb Racing from running:

### 1. ~~Code pages not executable~~ — **RESOLVED**

The ELF loader now uses the SplitMap technique: two `svcCreateCodeMemory` handles placed at adjacent virtual addresses. The code segment is mapped `MapSlave` (Rx) and the data segment `MapOwner` (Rw). ARM64 ADRP instructions can address ±4GB, so adjacent placement lets executed code reach GOT/data without any permission transitions. The old `0xD801` error no longer occurs.

### 2. ~~JMPREL unresolved~~ — **RESOLVED (all 403 entries)**

All 403 JMPREL entries in the crash reporter library resolve successfully. The test log confirms `JMPREL: all 403 entries processed` and `ELF: jmprel done`.

### 3. ~~SplitMap memcpy crash~~ — **RESOLVED**

After JMPREL, the ELF loader was crashing on `memcpy(code_heap_buf, ...)` because `svcCreateCodeMemory` was called too early, making the backing buffer inaccessible before we wrote to it. Fixed: `svcCreateCodeMemory` + `svcControlCodeMemory` are now deferred until after the memcpy.

### 4. ~~Native constructors~~ — **RESOLVED (all 417 run clean)**

Root cause: `jitTransitionToExecutable` made the entire JIT region RX, including the data segment, so the very first constructor writing a C++ global hit a permission fault. Fix: data-segment pages are flipped back to RW after the executable transition, matching the Android linker's layout. `ctors done ok=417 failed=0`.

### 5. ~~Game calls `abort()` after ~165s~~ — **RESOLVED**

Root cause: `std::random_device`'s constructor opens `/dev/urandom`, which doesn't exist on Horizon OS; the `-fno-exceptions` build turns that failure into an instant `abort()`. Fixed by serving `/dev/urandom` as a virtual file backed by the Switch's hardware RNG.

### 6. ~~No audio~~ — **RESOLVED**

A custom SDL2_mixer backend now serves every SimpleAudioEngine JNI call — background music and sound effects (OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC) decode straight from the extracted APK assets. Per-channel effect volume (used for the engine sound) is wired through; per-channel *pitch/rate* is not — SDL_mixer has no API for changing an individual channel's playback speed without a full custom resampling engine, so the engine note doesn't rise and fall with RPM yet (volume does).

### 7. ~~Background threads run synchronously~~ — **RESOLVED**

`pthread_create` now spawns real libnx threads (pinned off the render core), with real mutexes/condvars/semaphores/rwlocks backing the game's synchronization primitives.

### 8. ~~Touch input not delivered~~ — **RESOLVED**

Confirmed on hardware: SDL finger events drive the game's own touch natives, and the car is fully steerable.

### 9. Shop screen crashes back to the launcher — **ACTIVE INVESTIGATION**

Opening the in-game Shop crashes out to the Android Horizon menu. No fault or abort was captured in the log from the crash session (the log simply stops mid-stream with no exit marker), which pointed at a possible deadlock in the crash-forensics logger itself: if the crashing thread happened to fault while already holding the log's mutex (e.g. mid-format inside an ordinary log call), the old fault handler would try to take that same mutex to report the crash and hang forever — a real bug, now fixed with a lock-free emergency logger for exactly this scenario. The Shop is also the most network/IAP-heavy screen, and until this build `isNetworkAvailable` always claimed "online" regardless of the Switch's actual connection — an offline Switch reporting itself online could easily send the game into a real network call that has no chance of succeeding. Both fixes are in; needs a fresh test + log to confirm.

### 10. Save persistence — needs a confirmed round-trip test

The UserDefault store now loads from and saves to `<game>/userdefaults.bin` (ints, floats, bools, strings), and the compat log shows it loading and saving correctly during play. However this hasn't yet been confirmed by a full app-restart-and-relaunch test on hardware, so treat it as "implemented, not yet verified" rather than "working."

### 11. One game session per app launch

Launching a second game session in the same Android Horizon process reads garbage ("not an ARM binary") — leftover JIT memory regions and threads from the first session aren't unloaded. Currently guarded with an on-screen notice instead of a crash; a real unload path is future work.

## Performance Expectations (Hill Climb Racing 1.67.0)

We're testing the `.apk` release of **Hill Climb Racing 1.67.0** specifically — the current Play Store release ships as a `.xapk`. Android Horizon's APK parser only understands plain `.apk` files right now, so `.xapk` support is out of scope until a later phase.

Measured numbers from hardware:

- **A locked 60 fps during actual gameplay** — the theoretical ceiling is also the measured result. (Earlier builds measured ~18 fps in the menu before a logging bottleneck was found and fixed — see the 0.1.65 changelog entry — real gameplay performance is native-class.)
- Loading time has come down substantially since the early ~143 s measurement, once JNI log spam (thousands of save-key reads, each fsyncing to the SD card) was throttled — see 0.1.65.
- Hill Climb Racing was tuned for 2012-era phones far weaker than the Tegra X1, so there's little pressure on performance work right now; focus is on correctness (Shop crash, save verification) over speed.

## TODO / Roadmap

> Items are roughly ordered by priority. "Phase 0" is the current work.

### Phase 0 — Make any game do *something* (in progress)

- [x] APK browser UI with icon extraction
- [x] APK extraction (libs + assets) onto SD card
- [x] Custom ARM64 ELF loader with RELA relocation
- [x] JNI environment shim (fake JavaVM / JNIEnv)
- [x] EGL setup (GLES 2 + 3 shim table passthrough)
- [x] On-screen progress display during launch stages
- [x] Full diagnostic result screen with error details
- [x] Docked mode detection — footer warns when not in handheld mode
- [x] Early abort when code pages are not executable — shows diagnostic screen instead of crashing Switch
- [x] **SplitMap JIT** — adjacent RW+Rx dual-mapping via two `svcCreateCodeMemory` handles; 0xD801 blocker resolved
- [x] All 120+ unresolved symbols shimmed
- [x] **Per-constructor logging** — crash site shows in `compat_log.txt`
- [x] **Load all .so files** — all three libs loaded smallest-first; cross-library symbols available before constructors run
- [x] **40+ additional shims** — signal handling, thread naming, memory, barriers, etc.
- [x] **Live progress screen** — loader runs on a background thread; main thread renders at ~60fps with animated scan bar and live `compat_log.txt` tail (13 lines, colour-coded)
- [x] **Elapsed time per stage** — stage label shows "(Xs)" so you can tell how long each step is taking
- [x] **All 403 JMPREL entries resolved** — confirmed in hardware test
- [x] **All 417 constructors run clean** — JIT data pages flipped back to RW after executable transition
- [x] **Game boots and renders** — splash animation, full loading screen, menu logic, ~18 fps
- [x] **Crash forensics** — symbolized abort/exit backtraces, unrecovered-fault PC capture, game stderr + debug strings routed to compat log
- [x] **Automatic screenshots** — launcher screens + GL framebuffer at milestone frames saved to `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`
- [x] **Fixed the ~165s `abort()`** — root cause `/dev/urandom` missing on Horizon OS, served by the Switch CSRNG
- [x] **Touch input delivered** — SDL finger events → Cocos2dxRenderer touch natives (1:1 coords); B button → Android BACK key; **confirmed steering the car on hardware**
- [x] **Audio playback** — SDL2_mixer backend for SimpleAudioEngine (music + effects, OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC); **confirmed working on hardware** (engine, music)
- [x] **GAME IS PLAYABLE** — driving, touch, audio, 60fps, confirmed on Switch hardware
- [ ] Shop screen crash (active investigation — see Current Blockers #9)
- [ ] Confirm save persistence survives a full app restart

### Phase 1 — Touch input

- [x] Map Switch touchscreen events to the game's touch natives (direct `Java_...nativeTouches*` calls rather than the `AInputQueue`/`ALooper` path — simpler and confirmed working)
- [x] Docked-mode detection — footer shows warning when not in handheld mode

### Phase 2 — Stability

- [x] **Real `pthread` support using libnx `Thread`** — real threads, real mutex/condvar/rwlock/semaphore backing
- [x] Load all `.so` files in dependency order (smallest-first)
- [ ] Implement `dl_iterate_phdr` so stack unwinders work
- [x] **Save/load state** — UserDefaults persist to `<game>/userdefaults.bin` (needs a confirmed restart test, see blockers)
- [ ] Real `.so`/JIT unload so a second game session doesn't require restarting the app
- [ ] Engine/effect pitch control (needs a custom audio resampler — SDL_mixer has no per-channel rate API)

### Phase 3 — Polish

- [x] NRO icon (Android Horizon themed — green planet with curved text)
- [x] **Icon-themed UI** — animated starfield, planet-horizon scenery, borealis-style glowing focus card, HOS button glyphs from the system font
- [x] GitHub avatar on About screen (bundled static image — no runtime fetch)
- [x] About screen (press **−**)
- [x] Reinstall button (**X** in APK list)
- [x] Version bump system — NACP + in-app version both track the build number (`0.1.<build>`)
- [ ] Per-APK settings overlay (resolution, framerate cap)
- [ ] APK delete / manage from the UI

### Phase 4 — Real controller support (docked mode)

Hill Climb Racing has **native MOGA controller support already built in** — confirmed two ways: the extracted APK assets include reference button-layout images for both the **MOGA Pro** (dual analog sticks + shoulder buttons) and **MOGA Pocket** (compact, single stick + d-pad) controllers, and the compat log shows the game actually reading persisted onboarding flags for them (`moga_pro_guide`, `moga_pocket_guide`). MOGA controllers used a standard Xbox-style face-button layout — **A bottom, B right, X left, Y top** — which is diagonally swapped from the Switch's own layout (**A right, B bottom, X top, Y left**). That means real Joy-Con/Pro Controller support for this game specifically could be a relatively short path: map Switch physical buttons to the game's expected MOGA input, swapping **A↔B and X↔Y** so the face buttons land where the game expects them, rather than needing a full custom input scheme. This wouldn't need any game-side changes — cocos2d-x already listens for MOGA-style gamepad input, we'd just need to feed it.

This is the real blocker on docked mode: right now only touch input is implemented (handheld-only), which is why docked mode is disabled entirely — there's no controller input path yet at all, MOGA-shaped or otherwise. Not started; noted here as a promising, concrete lead for whoever picks this up next (PRs welcome).

### Not Planned (for now)

- Online / multiplayer games (Roblox, Fortnite, etc.)
- Google Play Services (GMS) stub
- ARM32 (`armeabi-v7a`) game support — Switch is 64-bit only

## Changelog

> Most recent first.

### 0.1.80 — Overlay confirmed working + permanent hide latch

- [x] **Overlay confirmed showing on real hardware** — the corner recalibration worked. Font/sizing is close to (not pixel-identical to) HCR's own version text — expected, since it's our own bundled font standing in for their bespoke one; can be tuned further with a fresh reference screenshot if wanted.
- [x] **Overlay now permanently disappears once past loading, not just per-frame** — previously it relied purely on a live pixel match every frame, which is correct but only reactive; now, once it's matched the loading screen at least once and then failed to match for a sustained ~1.5s (not just one flickered frame), it latches off for the rest of the session via the same one-shot-failure flag used for init errors. Guarantees it can't reappear later (e.g. if the vehicle/upgrade/menu screens ever briefly share similar dark corners during a transition) and skips the probe entirely for the rest of the session once latched, at zero further cost.

### 0.1.79 — Overlay finally calibrated correctly + a real lead on the flicker

- [x] **Overlay probe fully calibrated** — the two top corners were already matching in the last log, but the bottom-left corner reads genuinely darker `(16,19,27)` than the top corners `(46,51,63)` — the background vignette isn't uniform, it darkens further into that corner. Since all 3 probes have to match, this one wrong value was blocking the overlay every time even though 2 of 3 were already correct.
- [x] **New lead on the flicker surviving the 0.1.78 fix**: the crash log closes (and stops being useful) the moment the game loop exits, but the reported flicker happens afterward in the launcher's own menu code — meaning compat_log.txt structurally can't show it directly. Reasoning about what else could cause a *persistent* flicker independent of app state: the game can call `eglSwapInterval` to control its own frame pacing (e.g. uncapped/0 for smoother gameplay), and that setting is global to the graphics surface — it survives a crash. If left at 0, the launcher's renderer (which expects vsync-paced presentation) would present as fast as the driver allows with no frame pacing at all, which reads exactly like a persistent flicker. Now force vsync back on every time the game loop ends, crash or not.

### 0.1.78 — Flicker fix, "+" on the result screen, real probe calibration

- [x] **Found the actual cause of the freeze → fade → rapid black/frozen-frame flicker introduced last build** — the GL state reset added in 0.1.77 also called `eglSwapBuffers`/`SDL_GL_SwapWindow` directly. The launcher's own screens present via SDL_Renderer, which manages its own front/back-buffer bookkeeping internally and doesn't expect anything else swapping that surface — an extra out-of-band swap desynced it, and the result was two different rendering paths fighting over which buffer to show. Fix: reset the GL *state* (bindings, blend, viewport, a clear) but don't swap — the very next legitimate `SDL_RenderPresent` in the launcher's own screens now presents cleanly on its own.
- [x] **"+" didn't exit after a crash — not actually a bug.** The post-launch result/diagnostics screen only ever listened for **B**, never **+**; every other screen in the app treats + as a global quit. Added + to the result screen so it's consistent everywhere.
- [x] **Real pixel-probe calibration data came in** — the two screen corners actually read a blue-gray `(46,51,63)`, not the near-black originally guessed, and the loading-bar sample point turned out unstable (white early, darkening once the fill animation sweeps past it — not usable as a fixed fingerprint). Swapped it for a third corner instead; all three probes now use the real measured colour with a tighter, confirmed-safe tolerance.

### 0.1.77 — Overlay gating bug + post-crash white-screen fix

- [x] **Found why the overlay never showed** — `splashScreenHasCompleted` turns out to fire at ~8 seconds, long before the actual "HILL CLIMB RACING / LOADING..." screen with the version text ever appears. The overlay was gated on it, so the pixel-probe check got permanently disabled before the target screen was ever reached — it could never show. Now gated purely on the pixel fingerprint for the whole session (cheap, and specific enough not to false-positive during real gameplay).
- [x] **Root-caused the "+ button white box, then nothing, requires Home button" report** — the log showed a real crash (a wild-pointer fault, not related to +) right as the user quit, which our forensics caught and logged cleanly on our side — but the game draws directly via raw EGL/GLES on the *same* window/context the launcher's SDL_Renderer reuses afterward, and a crash mid-frame can leave GL state (bound shader/texture/buffer, scissor/stencil test, etc.) in whatever condition the interrupted draw call left it. SDL doesn't necessarily reset all of that before its own draws, so the launcher could end up rendering a corrupted frame instead of its menu. Fixed with a full GL state reset (unbind everything, disable scissor/stencil/depth/cull, standard blend, full viewport, clear) right as the game loop hands the window back to the launcher — applies after both crashes and clean exits.

### 0.1.75 — Pixel-fingerprint overlay timing + static avatar

- [x] **Branding overlay was showing during the Fingersoft logo animation, not just the loading screen** — `splashScreenHasCompleted` only fires once the *entire* splash+loading sequence ends, so it doesn't distinguish the early logo-only phase from the later "HILL CLIMB RACING / LOADING..." screen. Fixed with a pixel fingerprint: each frame, 3 fixed screen points are sampled (`glReadPixels`) and compared against colours estimated from a real handheld screenshot (dark vignette corners + the white loading bar); the overlay only draws when all 3 match. Actual vs. expected values are logged once a second so a wrong estimate is a one-log-file fix, not more guesswork.
- [x] **About screen avatar is now static** — no more background HTTPS fetch, no cache file, no worker thread. The real GitHub avatar is bundled directly into the NRO (`romfs:/avatar.png`) and loaded once at startup.

### 0.1.73 — Branding overlay black-screen fix + repositioning

- [x] **Fixed the branding overlay turning the screen black** — cocos2d-x keeps its own internal cache of GL state (current shader/buffer/texture/attributes) and skips re-setting things it thinks are unchanged. Our raw GL draw call changed real state behind its back, desyncing that cache; the game's very next draw call fed the GPU stale attribute data, producing a solid black frame. Fixed by saving every piece of global GL state we touch (program, bound buffer/texture, blend func, depth/cull enables) and restoring it exactly afterward, and moving our vertex attributes to indices 8/9 that cocos2d-x never touches.
- [x] Repositioned next to (not above) the game's own version text, matching a real handheld-mode screenshot — bolded our font to better match its weight. Position is an estimate (no way to pixel-measure a pasted screenshot without the underlying file); expect a follow-up nudge once seen live on hardware.

### 0.1.71 — Android Horizon branding on the game's loading screen

- [x] **Branding overlay** — while the game shows its own loading screen, Android Horizon now draws "Android Horizon v0.1.71" (white/green, matching the launcher's palette) in the bottom-left corner, right above the game's own version text. Implemented as a small standalone GLES2 textured quad composited directly into the game's rendered frame (drawn after `nativeRender()`, before the buffer swap) — not a hack of the game's own font/UI, just an independent overlay layered on top.
- [x] The overlay hides itself automatically the moment the game calls `splashScreenHasCompleted` (a real JNI hook, not a frame-count guess), so it never appears over menus or gameplay.
- [x] **Shop crash: real forensics captured for the first time** — `far=0xfffffffffffffff8` (address **-8**), a classic null-object/empty-container null+small-offset dereference, firing right as the game calls `trackPage(...)` (almost certainly `"Shop"`) and starts decoding shop item images. Leading theory: the shop looks up an in-app product our compat layer doesn't provide data for, and an unchecked "not found" path indexes a null/empty container. Not yet fixed — the crash site itself is deep in stripped game code we can't disassemble from here — but any future crash will now log with this same level of detail.

### 0.1.69 — Engine volume fix + crash-logger deadlock hardening

- [x] **Fixed the engine sound never stopping/fading** — the game continuously calls `setEffectVolume(id, volume)` to ramp the looping engine sound with RPM and to silence it on crash/pause/menu; this call was falling through to the generic no-op logger and being silently dropped, so the engine played at its initial volume forever. Now wired to a real per-channel `Mix_Volume`. (`setEffectRate`, the pitch counterpart, is a deliberate no-op — SDL_mixer has no per-channel playback-rate API without a custom resampler.)
- [x] **Real Switch connectivity reported to the game** — `isNetworkAvailable` now queries `nifm` instead of always claiming online. Matters for the Shop investigation: an offline Switch previously told the game it *was* online, which could push it into a real (doomed) network call.
- [x] **Crash-logger deadlock fixed** — the Shop-crash log had no fault/abort line at all, just silence. Root cause: if a thread faults while it already holds the normal logger's mutex (e.g. mid-format inside an ordinary log call), the old fault handler tried to take that same mutex to report the crash — permanent deadlock, no diagnostics, looks like a frozen game until force-quit. Added a lock-free emergency logger used only by the crash-forensics paths, so a fault can now always be recorded no matter what the crashing thread was doing.
- [x] Added the driving-gameplay and launch-result screenshots to this README — first real in-game screenshots from hardware.

### 0.1.68 — IT'S PLAYABLE + persistent saves

- [x] **HILL CLIMB RACING IS PLAYABLE ON SWITCH** — driving with touch steering, engine sounds, music, 60 fps. Confirmed on hardware. Known issues from the playtest below.
- [x] **Saves now persist** — the UserDefault store was RAM-only, so every launch looked like a first run (ToS screen again, progress lost). It now loads from `<game>/userdefaults.bin` before the game starts and saves on every `UserDefault.flush` and at exit. Ints, floats, bools, and strings all covered (floats/bools weren't even stored before).
- [x] **Real connectivity reported** — `isNetworkAvailable` now asks the Switch (nifm) instead of always claiming "online". An offline Switch gets Android's normal offline code paths — the game handles that natively, and it likely defuses the shop's network/IAP flows (the playtest's only crash).
- [x] **Effect volume fixed** — `playEffect`'s gain parameter was discarded, so looping effects (the engine!) played at 100%. Gain is now applied per channel. (Pitch modulation isn't supported by SDL_mixer, so the engine is volume-correct but monotone for now.)
- [x] **Relaunch guard** — launching a second game session in one app run crashes the loader (leftover JIT regions/threads from the first session; "not an ARM binary"). Until real unloading exists, a second launch shows a "restart Android Horizon to play again" notice instead of crashing.
- [x] Async Java callback pattern established (`compatFindGameSym`) — used for `returnCountryCode`, ready for `setServerTime`/`returnMissionJson`/`returnFileDownloadResult` if the game stalls on them.

### 0.1.66 — Touch confirmed + post-EULA spinner fixed

- [x] **TOUCH CONFIRMED WORKING** — the Terms-of-Service screen was accepted by tapping on hardware. Also: the logging diet pushed the game loop to a solid **60 fps** (frame counter: 300 frames per 5 s) — the SD-card fsyncs were throttling rendering too.
- [x] **Post-EULA spinner root-caused** — after accepting, the game calls `fetchCountryCode()`; on Android that's an async Java web request answered via the native callback `returnCountryCode(jstring)`. No reply = infinite spinner. The JNI layer now invokes the game's registered callback immediately with `"US"` (which also keeps the game on the simpler non-GDPR consent path).
- [x] **Music no longer keeps playing after quitting the game** — the mixer is silenced when the game loop exits back to the APK browser.

### 0.1.65 — Audio works! + loading-screen speedup

- [x] **AUDIO CONFIRMED WORKING ON HARDWARE** — build 64's Tremor fix holds: menu music (`bgmusic00.ogg`) loops from the Switch speakers while the game renders. First sound ever from an Android game on Horizon OS via this layer.
- [x] **"Stuck" loading screen root-caused: it wasn't stuck** — the game reads thousands of per-vehicle/per-stage save keys, and every read produced 3 compat-log lines each fsync'd to the SD card (~90 keys/second measured). The run was minutes from finishing when it looked frozen.
- [x] **JNI logging diet** — class/method/field lookups and repeated calls log once per unique message; save-key reads are silent with a periodic progress counter; writes log once per key. Loading should now be dramatically faster.

### 0.1.64 — The real frame-2 killer: vorbis ABI mismatch

- [x] **Frame-2 crash fully root-caused** — build 63 still crashed, and the forensics narrowed it to `_free_r` freeing SDL_mixer's own `sdl_seek_func` (an OGG callback *function*). Disassembling portlibs' `libSDL2_mixer.a` showed its OGG decoder calls `ov_read` with 4 arguments — the **Tremor** (`libvorbisidec`) ABI — while we linked regular `libvorbisfile`, whose `ov_read` takes 7 arguments and whose `OggVorbis_File` struct is a different size. `ov_open_callbacks` scribbled past the mixer's smaller struct on the first `preloadEffect(*.ogg)`, corrupting the heap.
- [x] **Fix:** link `-lvorbisidec` (Tremor) instead of `-lvorbisfile -lvorbis`, matching what SDL2_mixer was compiled against.

### 0.1.63 — Allocator crash root-caused: JNI string constants

- [x] **Build 59/60 frame-2 crash root-caused via the new forensics** — `svcQueryMemory` + host-symbol anchoring resolved the fault to newlib's `_free_r` writing a free-list link into our NRO's read-only segment: the game `free()`d a JNI string we handed it. On real Android, `GetStringUTFChars` returns a malloc'd copy (so game code that `free()`s it instead of calling `ReleaseStringUTFChars` gets away with it); ours returned the string constant itself.
- [x] **Fix 1:** `GetStringUTFChars` now returns a real heap copy (ART-compatible) and `ReleaseStringUTFChars` frees it.
- [x] **Fix 2:** guarded allocator — `free`/`realloc` verify the pointer is actually heap (`svcQueryMemory`) before touching it, and log the symbolized caller of any non-heap free instead of corrupting the allocator.
- [x] Mixer init now happens before the game loop starts (was lazily mid-frame).
- [x] New crash forensics stay in: fault pc/far region type+permissions, host addresses anchored to a known symbol for offline resolution against the build's `.elf`.

### 0.1.59 — Touch + audio

- [x] **Real threads worked** — build 56 reached the game's Terms-of-Service / privacy screen: fully loaded, rendering, interactive (2,280 frames over 339 s in the test run, clean exit via +). The remaining gaps were input and sound.
- [x] **Touch input** — SDL finger events are forwarded to the game's registered `Cocos2dxRenderer` natives: `nativeTouchesBegin`/`End` per finger, `nativeTouchesMove` with real JNI arrays (the fake JNI array layer now implements `GetArrayLength` and all typed `Get/SetArrayRegion` calls instead of returning zeros). Touchscreen coordinates map 1:1 to the game's 1280×720 surface.
- [x] **B button → Android BACK key** via `nativeKeyDown(AKEYCODE_BACK)` — backs out of game menus like on a phone.
- [x] **Audio** — new SDL2_mixer backend (`source/compat/audio.cpp`) behind all SimpleAudioEngine JNI calls: background music (play/stop/pause/resume/rewind/volume) and sound effects (preload/play/stop/volume, cached chunks), OGG/MP3/Opus/FLAC decoding, reading straight from the extracted APK assets.

### 0.1.56 — Real threads

- [x] **The urandom fix worked** — build 55 sailed past the old ~170s abort: `std::random_device` now reads the Switch CSRNG, and the game went on to initialize vehicles, achievements, and event assets. New blocker: it spawned a persistent asset-loader thread, and the old "run thread functions synchronously" shim froze the game on the HCR loading screen.
- [x] **`pthread_create` now creates real threads** (libnx `threadCreate`, 1 MB stack, pinned to cores 1/2 so workers can't starve the render loop on core 0), each with its own fake Bionic TLS block. `pthread_self`/`pthread_equal`/`pthread_join` are consistent between creator and thread.
- [x] **Real synchronization** — mutexes/condvars/rwlocks/semaphores are now backed by newlib/libnx primitives embedded inside the game's larger Bionic structs (recursive semantics; Bionic's static recursive-initializer bit pattern sanitized). `pthread_cond_timedwait` converts Bionic absolute timeouts and returns Bionic's `ETIMEDOUT`.
- [x] **Thread-safety hardening** — the compat logger and the JNI UserDefault store are mutex-guarded; crash recovery only `longjmp`s on the thread that armed it (worker faults get the symbolized unrecovered-fault log instead).

### 0.1.55 — Abort root-caused: `/dev/urandom`

- [x] **The ~170s abort is fully root-caused** — build 54's symbolized backtrace shows `std::random_device` ctor → `__throw_system_error` → `abort()`. The ctor opens `/dev/urandom` through bionic's *fortified* `__open_2` (which our logging never saw), the path doesn't exist on Horizon OS, and the `-fno-exceptions` build turns the throw into an abort.
- [x] **Fix: `/dev/urandom` virtual fd** — `open`/`__open_2` on `/dev/urandom` (or `/dev/random`) now return a magic fd backed by the Switch's hardware CSRNG; `read`/`__read_chk`/`close` handle it transparently.
- [x] Screenshots confirmed working on hardware — launcher UI, live loading screen, Fingersoft splash (frame 30), and the HCR loading bar (frame 300) all captured automatically.

### 0.1.53+ — The game renders!

- [x] **Hill Climb Racing boots on hardware** — Fingersoft splash animates, loading screen completes, menu logic runs at ~18 fps. Root cause of the constructor crashes: the JIT transition made data pages RX; they're now flipped back to RW, and all 417 ctors pass.
- [x] **Crash identified & instrumented** — the game calls `abort()` at ~165s from libc++'s `__throw_system_error` path (confirmed by symbolized caller: `libgame.so` `error_category::equivalent+0xec`). Added: frame-pointer backtrace with per-frame symbolization on abort/exit, unrecovered-fault PC/LR capture in the exception handler, recovery window widened over the whole game loop (incl. `eglSwapBuffers`).
- [x] **Game output captured** — `debugStringOnAndroid` JNI payloads, writes to the game's stdout/stderr (including through the fake Bionic `__sF`), and `android_set_abort_message` all land in `compat_log.txt` now.
- [x] **`getrandom` implemented** — `syscall(__NR_getrandom)`, `getentropy`, and `getrandom` are backed by the Switch CSRNG (`std::random_device` suspect for the abort).
- [x] **Automatic screenshots** — launcher saves `ui_menu/ui_loading/ui_result/ui_about.png`; the game loop saves the GL framebuffer at frames 30/300/900. All in `sdmc:/AndroidHorizonNX/screenshots/`.
- [x] **Epic UI overhaul** — icon-matched theme: gradient space sky, 110 twinkling/drifting stars, green planet horizon with glowing rim (cached to a texture), borealis-style eased focus card with pulsing glow, real HOS button glyphs (, , …) from the NintendoExt system font with chip fallback, translucent header/footer, 60 fps menu.
- [x] **Version system** — NACP version (shown in hbmenu) and the in-app version both derive from the auto-incrementing build number; the stale `.nacp` is regenerated every build.

### Loader bring-up

- [x] **SplitMap crash fixed** — root cause: `svcCreateCodeMemory` was called before `memcpy`, making the backing buffer inaccessible at userspace. Fixed by deferring `svcCreateCodeMemory` + `svcControlCodeMemory` to after the memcpy. All three `.so` files should now load past the ELF copy stage.
- [x] **RELA/JMPREL logging dramatically reduced** — removed per-entry log lines (one `fflush` per entry on FAT32 was taking ~38 seconds for libapplovin alone). Now only unresolved symbols, WARN lines, and the end-of-table summary are logged — `applyRela` goes from ~8000 lines to ~30 per library.
- [x] **+ button exits progress screen** — press **+** at any time during ELF loading to stop waiting and return to the APK list
- [x] **Renamed to Android Horizon / AndroidHorizonNX** — reflects the project's purpose (Android on HorizonOS) more clearly
- [x] **Live animated progress screen** — loader now runs on a background libnx thread; main thread renders at ~60fps with: animated scan bar (always moving, independent of load progress), live tail of `compat_log.txt` (13 lines, colour-coded for errors/warnings), elapsed time display per stage, "still working" notice after 30s
- [x] **Log timestamps** — every `compat_log.txt` entry prefixed with `[Xs]` seconds-since-launch
- [x] **Immediate constructor logging** — each `ELF: ctor[k/417] @ptr` is force-flushed to disk and the live display the instant before the constructor runs, so a hanging constructor is immediately identifiable
- [x] **"Please wait" patience notice** — log and screen show total constructor count and estimated time before the phase begins
- [x] **Avatar fix** — `socketInitializeDefault()` added so curl/BSD sockets work in homebrew; GitHub URL corrected to Aaronateataco
- [x] **Expanded log ring buffer** (5×92 → 20×128 bytes) for richer in-memory log feed
- [x] **All 403 JMPREL entries resolve** — hardware-confirmed; constructors are now the active frontier
- [x] **Android Horizon icon** — green planet with "ANDROID HORIZON" curved above the horizon, space background with stars
- [x] **About screen** (press **−**) with GitHub avatar (bundled static image) + project info
- [x] **Reinstall button** (**X**) — re-extracts APK without needing to delete the game folder

### [Previous builds]

- [x] **Performance Expectations section** added to README
- [x] **APK chooser QoL**: WebP icon decoding, linear icon scaling, colored monogram placeholders, larger icons, file size shown per APK
- [x] **Heap staging buffer for ELF loading** — fixed hard crash on first write to JIT-writable memory
- [x] **Per-relocation-entry logging + bounds checks** in `applyRela()` — bounds-checks `sym.st_name` against `DT_STRSZ`, caps `R_AARCH64_COPY` size at 64KB
- [x] **Per-constructor logging** — `elfRunCtors()` logs each constructor address + index and flushes before calling it
- [x] **Load all .so files** — replaced `findMainSo` with `findAllSos`; all three libs are loaded smallest-first
- [x] **40+ new shims** — `sigaction`, signal sets, `prctl`, `gettid`, `getpid`, `getuid`, `getgid`, `getauxval`, `mprotect`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `pipe`, `dup`, `dup2`, `ioctl`, `access`, `chmod`, `fchmod`, `lstat`, `pthread_setname_np`, `pthread_getname_np`, `pthread_attr_setstack`, `pthread_barrier_*`, `kill`, `raise`, `pthread_kill`, `sleep`, `usleep`, `clock_nanosleep`, `strtod_l`, `strtof_l`, `__register_atfork`
- [x] **ELF loader: SplitMap JIT** — `MapSlave` (Rx) + `MapOwner` (Rw) at adjacent VAs; 0xD801 blocker resolved
- [x] **120+ shims**: `setjmp`/`longjmp`, `sem_*`, all time functions, all wide-char and locale functions, all Bionic fortified string wrappers, networking stubs, `android_set_abort_message`, `sincosf`, `stpcpy`, `vasprintf`, `vsscanf`, `strerror`, `strtold`, `puts`/`putchar`, `rename`/`remove`, `__sF`, `__stack_chk_guard`, `pthread_mutexattr_*`, `__cxa_finalize`
- [x] Capture svc result codes from ELF loader and surface on diagnostic screen
- [x] Abort launch early when code pages not executable — diagnostic screen instead of Switch crash
- [x] Add `LaunchResult` struct — structured error info instead of bare bool
- [x] Add `ProgressCb` callback — UI shows each launch stage on-screen in real time
- [x] Docked mode detection — footer turns amber and warns

## Launch Video (Draft Script — Unreleased)

> This is a script for a showcase video Aaron recorded, releasing later. Kept here for reference only — **the bugs and limitations it describes are not being actioned from this script**; they're tracked (or not) through the normal [Current Blockers](#current-blockers) section based on separate hardware testing.

**[Intro & The Hook]**

Hi, my name's Aaron, and for the past few weeks, I've been working on a native way to play Android games directly inside of Horizon OS on the Nintendo Switch. To be clear: this isn't running through Lineage OS. This is a custom translation layer running straight through the Switch's native operating system. I mostly had AI "vibe code" this for me, but it's honestly amazing how far it's gotten. Let me show you how it works.

**[The Setup & Demo]**

When you first load in, you start here and drop in your APK file. The installation is super quick. A quick heads-up: I've only really tested Hill Climb Racing version 1.67. I didn't use the absolute latest version because it uses an XAPK format with multiple files, which might cause issues right now.

If you try other games or versions, they might crash or just be completely broken. But for this specific version, once you get past a little bit of loading lag at the start, it boots right in and is highly playable. Oh, and it actually supports saves now, which my last build didn't!

**[Current Limitations & Bugs]**

Since this is the very first playable build, there is some jank. Here is what you need to know if you test it:

- **Audio:** There's no sound in this capture, but the app does output audio. Fair warning: there's a bug where the engine noise is super loud and gets stuck playing. I'll fix that in a future update.
- **Controls:** Touch controls are slightly buggy. Sometimes inputs drop, which is why you see me accidentally neck-flipping in the video while holding the buttons down.
- **No Docked Mode:** I disabled docked mode because there's no controller support yet. Handheld touch-controls only for now, which is why the video lighting is a bit rough — you can't easily use a capture card.
- **Performance:** Hitting the "play" button is a bit laggy since it's not optimized yet, and the frame rate drops when you use certain power-ups.
- **Crashes:** Don't try to open the shop or use online features. Hitting the share button just gives an empty achievement, and going online might crash it.

The good news? When it does crash, it just safely drops you back to the Android Horizon app. It actually handles the crashes natively, so you don't get kicked out to that scary Atmosphere error screen with all the binaries!

**[Tech Specs & Outro]**

For those wondering about the setup, I'm running this on a modded V1 Switch — not an OLED — using firmware version 22.1 and the latest version of Atmosphere. I'm running this through sysCFW instead of emuMMC to save SD card space, mostly because I made a silly mistake with Tinfoil a few years ago and am already banned from Nintendo servers anyway.

The whole project is open-source and up on GitHub. If you know what you're doing, please send a pull request! I would love some help developing this further, adding controller support, and getting more games to run.

Thanks for watching, go test it out, and have fun!

## About

Made by [Aaron](https://aaronworld.uk) — a non-developer who wanted to see Android games on their modded Switch, and is figuring it out one step at a time with the help of Claude AI.

> **~99.8% of all code in this repo was written by [Claude](https://anthropic.com) (claude-sonnet-4-6 model).** I describe the problem, test on real hardware, and point out what's broken. Claude writes the fixes. This is an honest experiment in AI-assisted hardware hacking.

If this interests you, star the repo and check back. Progress will be slow but real.
